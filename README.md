# General

The main purpose of this project is demonstration of workability of application based on two technologies:
1) Client side on React-Admin framework;
2) Server side on Node-Red tool.

# React-Admin

React-Admin is a framework based on ReactJS-library. Basis functionality of this tool is adaptated to create the client side of CMS.

It was developed and maintains by french Marmelab company.

Tutorial for React-Admin framework is available by this link:

# Node-Red 

Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
                                           
It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

It was developed by IBMâ€™s Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the JS Foundation.

# Installation

This application is available by GitHub link:
https://github.com/RippleOSI/ReactAdmin-NodeRed-Redis-v1

Clone the project from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RippleOSI/ReactAdmin-NodeRed-Redis-v1
```

Install all required dependencies:
```
$ cd My-Project
$ npm install
```

Run the application locally:
``` 
$ npm start
```

After this application is available at your local machine by the link http://localhost:3000, but your application can't work because server side is absent yet.

You should install Node-Red at your local machine:
``` 
$ docker run -it -d -p 1880:1880 --name my-nodered nodered/node-red-docker
$ docker exec -it my-nodered bash
$ npm install node-red-contrib-redis
$ exit
$ docker stop my-nodered
$ docker start my-nodered
$ docker run -it -p 6379:6379 -d -v 'DIRECTORY_PATH'/redis.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf --name my-redis redis redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
``` 

Node-Red is available by this link: http://loocalhost:1880

After this you should import required flows to your local Node-Red. Flows are located inside your project in the **/flows** directory.
